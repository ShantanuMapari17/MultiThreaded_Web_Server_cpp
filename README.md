# Simple_Server_cpp

Build a multi-threaded web server. The web server is able to handle simple HTTP requests and return suitable responses. 
It uses a master-worker thread pool architecture to handle multiple concurrent clients.
Where the master thread accepts new connections and the HTTP processing is done by the worker threads in the thread pool.
