In this assignment, you will build a multi-threaded web server. The web server must be able to handle simple HTTP requests and return suitable responses. It must use a master-worker thread pool architecture to handle multiple concurrent clients, where the master thread accepts new connections and the HTTP processing is done by the worker threads in the thread pool.

Detailed instructions on how to solve this assignment, by building the server incrementally step-by-step, can be found here (please skip the parts mentioned as optional in this description).

# MultiThreaded_Web_Server_cpp


Build a multi-threaded web server. The web server is able to handle simple HTTP requests and return suitable responses. 
It uses a master-worker thread pool architecture to handle multiple concurrent clients.
Where the master thread accepts new connections and the HTTP processing is done by the worker threads in the thread pool.

Build a load generator and perform a load test on the web server
